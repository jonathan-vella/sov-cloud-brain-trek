## Style Guide

### Markdown Standards

This project uses markdownlint with custom configuration. Key rules:

- ATX-style headings (`#`, `##`, `###`)
- Dash (`-`) for unordered lists
- Blank lines around headings and lists
- Fenced code blocks with language specifiers
- No trailing punctuation in headings (except `?`)

### Code Blocks

Always specify the language:

````markdown
```powershell
Get-AzResourceGroup -Name "sovereign-rg"
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
```
````

### Links

- **Internal links:** Use relative paths (`../level-100/topic.md`)
- **External links:** Use full URLs with descriptive text
- **Microsoft Learn:** Include as references where applicable

### Callouts

Use Jekyll callout syntax:

```markdown
{: .note }
> **Note:** Additional helpful information.

{: .warning }
> **Warning:** Important caution for the reader.
```
