### Question 4: RAG Retrieval Strategy

Production RAG returns irrelevant results 15% of the time. What is the FIRST optimization to try?

A) Increase number of retrieved chunks (k) from 5 to 20  
B) Implement hybrid retrieval: Dense vectors + keyword search  
C) Switch to larger embedding model  
D) Add reranking model after initial retrieval

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
**Reranking** is the most effective single improvement for retrieval quality:

**Retrieval Pipeline with Reranking:**

**Stage 1: Initial Retrieval (Fast & Broad)**

- Retrieve k=20 documents (over-retrieve)
- Vector similarity search
- Latency: 30-50ms

**Stage 2: Reranking (Accurate & Focused)**

- Apply cross-encoder reranker model
- Compare query to each retrieved doc
- Score and re-rank
- Select top 5 for LLM context
- Latency: 50-100ms

**Stage 3: LLM Generation**

- Use top 5 reranked documents
- Generate response
- Latency: 80-150ms

**Why Reranking Works:**

- ✅ **Dense vectors miss semantic nuance:** Reranker adds precision
- ✅ **Cross-encoder models more accurate:** See full query-doc interaction
- ✅ **Reduces false positives dramatically:** 15% → 3-5% error rate
- ✅ **Latency acceptable:** 50-100ms overhead worth accuracy gain

**Reranker Options:**

- `ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2` (Fast, 12-layer)
- `cross-encoder/ms-marco-TinyBERT` (Faster, less accurate)
- Custom fine-tuned on domain data (Best)

**Why NOT Others:**

- **A:** More chunks = more noise; makes problem worse
- **B:** Hybrid helps but reranking more impactful as first step
- **C:** Larger embedding expensive; marginal gain

### Question 5: Knowledge Base Chunking Strategy

Ingesting technical documentation with complex tables and diagrams. What chunking strategy is BEST?

A) Fixed 512-token chunks with 50-token overlap  
B) Semantic chunking based on document structure (sections, tables)  
C) Sentence-level chunks (one sentence per chunk)  
D) Full document as single chunk

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
**Semantic/structural chunking** preserves context and meaning:

**Chunking Strategy:**

**1. Respect Document Structure:**

- ✅ Sections/headings as natural boundaries
- ✅ Tables kept intact (don't split mid-table)
- ✅ Code blocks preserved
- ✅ Lists maintained

**2. Target Chunk Size:**

- 256-512 tokens (LLM context window consideration)
- Flexible based on content boundaries
- Overlap: 10-20% with adjacent chunks

**3. Metadata Enrichment:**

- ✅ Document title
- ✅ Section heading
- ✅ Page number
- ✅ Content type (text, table, code)
- ✅ Last updated date

**Example: Technical Doc**

```text
Chunk 1: Section "Architecture Overview"
  - Full section text
  - Includes architecture diagram reference
  - Metadata: {section: "Architecture", type: "overview"}

Chunk 2: Section "Component Details" + Table
  - Section text + full component table
  - Table NOT split across chunks
  - Metadata: {section: "Components", type: "table"}
```

**Why NOT Others:**

- **A:** Fixed chunks split tables, code blocks; loses context
- **C:** Sentence-level too granular; loses paragraph context
- **D:** Full doc too large; LLM cannot focus on relevant part

**Benefits:**

- Better retrieval relevance
- Preserved context
- Easier to cite sources
- Better LLM reasoning

A) Replace all edge instances simultaneously  
B) Blue-green deployment with instant cutover  
C) Canary deployment: 5% → 25% → 100% with validation gates  
D) A/B testing with random 50/50 split

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
**Canary deployment with gates** provides safest rollout with early issue detection:

**Canary Deployment Process:**

**Phase 1: Canary (5% - 2 hours)**

- ✅ Deploy to 5% of edge nodes
- ✅ Monitor key metrics:
  - Response quality (human eval sample)
  - Latency (P50, P99)
  - Error rate
  - Resource utilization
- ✅ **Gate:** Manual approval after 2 hours if green

**Phase 2: Expanded Canary (25% - 24 hours)**

- Deploy to 25% of nodes
- Monitor same metrics at scale
- Check for edge cases/rare issues
- **Gate:** Auto-proceed if metrics within 5% of baseline

**Phase 3: Full Rollout (100% - 48 hours)**

- Deploy to remaining 75%
- Continue monitoring
- Rollback plan ready

**Validation Gates:**

```text
Gate Criteria:
- Error rate < 1%
- P99 latency < baseline + 20%
- Quality score > 95% of baseline
- No critical issues reported
```

**Rollback Procedure:**

- Keep previous model version
- One-command rollback
- < 5 minute rollback time

**Why NOT Others:**

- **A:** All-at-once risks widespread outage if issues
- **B:** Blue-green good but canary provides more gradual validation
- **D:** A/B testing for experimentation, not deployment

### Question 7: Model Monitoring - Data Drift Detection

Detecting when RAG model needs retraining. Which metric is the PRIMARY indicator of data drift?

A) Inference latency increasing  
B) User query distribution shifting significantly from training data  
C) Memory usage increasing  
D) Error logs growing

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
**Query distribution shift** indicates model sees data it wasn't trained for:

**Data Drift Detection:**

**1. Query Embedding Drift:**

- ✅ Cluster user queries in embedding space
- ✅ Compare to training data distribution
- ✅ Measure: KL divergence, Wasserstein distance
- ✅ **Threshold:** > 0.3 KL divergence = significant drift

**2. Topic Drift:**

- Track query topics over time
- New topics emerging
- Old topics declining
- Example: Sudden surge in regulatory questions after law change

**3. Vocabulary Drift:**

- New terminology appearing
- Out-of-vocabulary rate increasing

**Monitoring Approach:**

```python
# Collect query embeddings
current_embeddings = embed(queries_last_week)
training_embeddings = load(training_set_embeddings)

# Calculate drift
drift_score = kl_divergence(current_embeddings, training_embeddings)

if drift_score > 0.3:
    alert("Significant data drift detected")
    trigger_retraining_evaluation()
```

**Retraining Triggers:**

- Drift score > threshold
- User satisfaction < 85%
- Manual reports of poor quality
- New data domain added

**Why NOT Others:**

- **A:** Latency drift indicates system issues, not data drift
- **C:** Memory usage not related to data distribution
- **D:** Errors indicate bugs, not drift

C) Create separate index for new docs; query both  
D) Manual merge of vectors

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
**Incremental updates** provide efficiency and minimal disruption:

**Incremental Update Process:**

**1. Identify Changed Documents:**

- ✅ Track document modification timestamps
- ✅ Checksum/hash comparison
- ✅ 50K changed docs out of 10M = 0.5%

**2. Re-embed Changed Documents:**

- Run embedding model on 50K docs
- Generate new vectors
- Time: ~1-2 hours (depending on hardware)

**3. Update Vector Index:**

- Modern vector DBs support incremental updates
- Delete old vectors for changed docs
- Insert new vectors
- Update index structure
- Time: ~15-30 minutes

**4. Validate:**

- Spot-check retrieval for updated docs
- Ensure no index corruption
- Monitor query performance

**Total Time: 2-3 hours (vs. 24+ hours for full reindex)**

**Why NOT Others:**

- **A:** Full reindex wasteful; 9.95M docs unchanged
- **C:** Multiple indexes complicate queries; merge complexity
- **D:** Manual merge error-prone and not scalable

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Fast updates (hours vs. days)
- ✅ No service interruption
- ✅ Resource efficient
- ✅ Scalable approach

B) 1-3% degradation in task performance  
C) 10-15% degradation  
D) Model becomes unusable

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
**INT8 quantization has minimal quality impact** with proper calibration:

**Quantization Analysis:**

**FP16 (Baseline):**

- 16 bits per weight
- Full precision
- Quality: 100% (reference)

**INT8 (Quantized):**

- 8 bits per weight
- 50% memory reduction
- Quality: 97-99% of FP16
- **Degradation: 1-3% typically**

**Quantization Process:**

1. **Calibration:** Run on representative dataset
2. **Range Finding:** Determine min/max values per layer
3. **Quantization:** Map FP16 range to INT8 range
4. **Validation:** Measure quality impact

**Quality Metrics:**

- Perplexity: +1-2% increase (acceptable)
- Task accuracy: -1-3% decrease
- User satisfaction: Negligible impact

**INT4 Comparison:**

- 4 bits per weight
- 75% memory reduction
- Quality: 90-95% of FP16
- **Degradation: 5-10%** (more noticeable)

**When to Use:**

- INT8: Production default (best balance)
- INT4: Extreme resource constraints only
- FP16: When quality is paramount

**Why NOT Others:**

- **A:** Some degradation inevitable but minimal
- **C/D:** Only with poor quantization or INT4/lower

### Question 10: Batch Processing for Throughput

RAG system needs to process 10K user queries in batch overnight. What optimization provides BEST throughput?

A) Process queries sequentially with full model  
B) Batch retrieval + batch inference with dynamic batching  
C) Scale up to larger GPU for each query  
D) Use multiple separate model instances

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
**Batch processing leverages parallelism** for maximum throughput:

**Optimized Batch Processing:**

**1. Batch Retrieval (Vectorization):**

```python
# Embed all queries at once
query_embeddings = embed_batch(queries, batch_size=128)
# Time: 10K queries / 128 per batch = 78 batches × 200ms = 16 seconds

# Batch vector search
results = vector_db.search_batch(query_embeddings, k=5)
# Time: 78 batches × 50ms = 4 seconds
```

**2. Dynamic Batch Inference:**

```python
# Group queries by similar length (for efficiency)
batches = create_dynamic_batches(queries, max_batch_size=32)

# Process batches in parallel
for batch in batches:
    responses = model.generate(batch, batch_size=32)
# Time: 10K / 32 = 313 batches × 500ms = 157 seconds
```

**Total Time: ~3 minutes** (vs. 10K × 500ms = 83 minutes sequential)

**Throughput Gain: 28x**

**Dynamic Batching Benefits:**

- ✅ Amortizes model load overhead
- ✅ Better GPU utilization (80%+ vs. 20-30%)
- ✅ Reduced memory transfers
- ✅ Optimal for batch workloads

**Why NOT Others:**

- **A:** Sequential leaves GPU idle; 28x slower
- **C:** Larger GPU helps but batching more impactful
- **D:** Multiple instances adds overhead without batching benefit

**Reference:** [Performance Optimization](edge-rag-optimization#batch-processing)
</details>

- ✅ Cache final LLM responses
- ✅ Semantic similarity matching (similar queries)
- ✅ Hit: Instant response (< 5ms)
- ✅ TTL: 1-4 hours (context-dependent)
- ✅ **Benefit:** Avoids entire pipeline

**Layer 2: Retrieval Cache**

- ✅ Cache vector search results
- ✅ Key: Query embedding
- ✅ Hit: Skip retrieval (save 30-50ms)
- ✅ TTL: 15-60 minutes
- ✅ **Benefit:** Still personalizes response but skips retrieval

**Layer 3: Embedding Cache**

- ✅ Cache query embeddings
- ✅ Exact match only
- ✅ Hit: Skip embedding (save 20-50ms)
- ✅ TTL: 5-30 minutes
- ✅ **Benefit:** Useful for repeated exact queries

**Cache Hit Rates (Typical):**

- Semantic cache: 15-30% (high value)
- Retrieval cache: 20-40%
- Embedding cache: 30-50%

**Combined Latency:**

```text
No cache: 200ms average
With caching: 60-100ms average (50% reduction)
```

**Cache Invalidation:**

- Knowledge base updates: Clear retrieval cache
- Model updates: Clear all caches
- Time-sensitive data: Aggressive TTLs

**Why NOT Others:**

- **A/B/C:** Single-layer caching misses optimization opportunities
- **D:** Multi-layer captures benefits at each stage

**Semantic versioning with rollout control** provides safety and consistency:

**Versioning Strategy:**

**Semantic Versioning (SemVer):**

```text
Version Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
Example: 2.3.1

MAJOR (2): Breaking changes (schema change, major content restructure)
MINOR (3): New content added (new documents, sections)
PATCH (1): Corrections/updates (fixes, small updates)
```

**Version Metadata:**

```json
{
  "version": "2.3.1",
  "created": "2025-10-15",
  "documents": 10483,
  "vectors": 10483000,
  "size_gb": 87.5,
  "changelog": "Added Q4 2025 regulatory updates",
  "compatible_models": ["v1.2.x", "v1.3.x"]
}
```

**Controlled Rollout:**

**Phase 1: Staging (1 site, 48 hours)**

- Deploy to staging environment
- Validate quality
- Check compatibility

**Phase 2: Canary (5% sites, 1 week)**

- Deploy to 5% of edge sites
- Monitor query quality
- Check for issues

**Phase 3: Production (100%, 2 weeks)**

- Gradual rollout
- Per-site validation
- Automated rollback on failure

**Rollback Capability:**

- Keep previous 2 versions on edge
- One-command rollback
- < 10 minute rollback time

**Why NOT Others:**

- **A:** No rollback; risky for quality issues
- **C:** Version fragmentation; inconsistent experience
- **D:** Continuous updates lack validation gates

### Question 17: Performance Troubleshooting

Production RAG P99 latency increased from 800ms to 2500ms. What is the FIRST diagnostic step?

A) Restart all edge services  
B) Review monitoring dashboards for component-level latency breakdown  
C) Scale up edge hardware immediately  
D) Switch to smaller model

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
**Component-level analysis** identifies the bottleneck before taking action:

**Latency Breakdown Analysis:**

**Healthy Baseline:**

```text
Query → Embedding: 50ms
Embedding → Retrieval: 80ms
Retrieval → LLM: 30ms
LLM Inference: 500ms
Response Processing: 40ms
Total: 700ms ✅
```

**Current (Degraded):**

```text
Query → Embedding: 50ms (unchanged)
Embedding → Retrieval: 80ms (unchanged)
Retrieval → LLM: 30ms (unchanged)
LLM Inference: 2200ms ❌ (4.4x increase!)
Response Processing: 40ms (unchanged)
Total: 2400ms
```

**Root Cause Identified: LLM Inference**

**Next Steps:**

1. Check GPU/CPU utilization (thermal throttling?)
2. Check concurrent requests (resource contention?)
3. Review recent model changes
4. Check system logs for errors

**Common Causes:**

- ✅ Resource contention (too many concurrent queries)
- ✅ Hardware degradation (thermal throttling, memory issues)
- ✅ Model change (accidental switch to larger model)
- ✅ Batch size misconfiguration

**Why NOT Others:**

- **A:** Restart doesn't address root cause; may hide symptoms temporarily
- **C:** Scale up expensive; may not solve problem if software issue
- **D:** Model change too drastic without diagnosis

**Monitoring Best Practice:** Always instrument each pipeline stage separately.

### Question 18: Enterprise Governance

Multi-tenant RAG system must ensure data isolation. What architecture enforces STRONGEST isolation?

A) Logical isolation: Single model + vector DB, filter by tenant ID  
B) Physical isolation: Separate model instance + vector DB per tenant  
C) Shared model + separate vector DB per tenant  
D) Separate models + shared vector DB with encryption

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
**Physical isolation** provides strongest security and compliance:

**Multi-Tenant Isolation Options:**

**Option A: Logical Isolation**

```text
Architecture:
- Single model instance
- Single vector database
- Row-level security (tenant_id filter)

Pros: Cost-efficient, easy management
Cons:
❌ Risk of query/response leakage (bug/misconfiguration)
❌ Noisy neighbor problem
❌ Difficult to prove isolation for compliance
```

**Option B: Physical Isolation (RECOMMENDED)**

```text
Architecture:
- Separate model instance per tenant
- Separate vector database per tenant
- Separate compute/memory/storage

Pros:
✅ Complete isolation (bug cannot leak data)
✅ Independent scaling per tenant
✅ Clear compliance story
✅ Tenant-specific customization

Cons: Higher cost, more complex management
```

**Option C: Hybrid**

```text
Architecture:
- Shared model (reasonable)
- Separate vector DB per tenant (good)

Pros: Balanced
Cons:
⚠️ Model could theoretically leak between tenants
⚠️ Moderate compliance risk
```

**Option D: Inverted Hybrid**

```text
Architecture:
- Separate models (good)
- Shared vector DB (bad)

Cons:
❌ Defeats purpose; vector DB leakage risk highest
```

**Recommendation for Sovereign/Regulated:**

- Use **Option B** for high-security environments
- Accept higher cost for compliance assurance
- Use containerization/K8s for management at scale

**Cost Management:**

- Use quantized models (lower memory)
- Schedule model unloading for inactive tenants
- Optimize vector DB storage
