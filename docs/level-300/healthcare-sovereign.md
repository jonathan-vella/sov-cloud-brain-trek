## Overview

Healthcare organizations must balance regulatory compliance (HIPAA, GDPR for EU patients) with the need for modern cloud capabilities including AI/ML for clinical decision support. This architecture provides a blueprint for sovereign healthcare deployments.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will be able to:

- ✅ Design HIPAA-compliant Azure architectures
- ✅ Implement PHI data protection controls
- ✅ Configure healthcare-specific security monitoring
- ✅ Enable AI/ML workloads with data sovereignty

## Healthcare Architecture



### Key Components

#### Security & Identity Layer

| Component | Purpose | Configuration |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| Microsoft Entra ID | Identity provider | MFA required for all users |
| Conditional Access | Risk-based access | Block access from non-approved locations |
| Microsoft Sentinel | Security monitoring | HIPAA compliance workbook enabled |
| Key Vault (HSM) | Key management | FIPS 140-2 Level 3 HSM |

#### Network Security

- **Web Application Firewall (WAF) v2** — OWASP protection for patient portals
- **Azure Firewall Premium** — Deep packet inspection, TLS termination
- **Private VNet** — No direct internet access to PHI systems

#### Data Protection

- **SQL Server with TDE + CMK** — Customer-managed encryption keys
- **Cosmos DB with encryption** — PHI document storage
- **Blob Storage with CMK** — Medical imaging and files

## HIPAA Safeguards Implementation

### Administrative Safeguards

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|---------------|
| Security Officer | Designated in Entra ID with PIM |
| Risk Assessment | Microsoft Defender for Cloud |
| Workforce Training | Tracked via Azure AD app |
| Contingency Plan | Azure Backup + Site Recovery |

### Technical Safeguards

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|---------------|
| Access Control | Entra ID + Conditional Access |
| Audit Controls | Log Analytics + Sentinel |
| Integrity Controls | Blob immutability + TDE |
| Transmission Security | TLS 1.3 + Private Endpoints |

### Physical Safeguards

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|---------------|
| Facility Access | Azure datacenter controls (SOC 2) |
| Workstation Security | Intune MDM policies |
| Device Controls | Azure AD device compliance |

## FHIR API Integration

For interoperability with healthcare systems:

```yaml
# Azure API for FHIR configuration
apiConfiguration:
  kind: "fhir-R4"
  accessPolicies:
    - objectId: "{EHR-App-ObjectId}"
      permissions: ["read", "write"]
  exportConfiguration:
    storageAccountName: "phiexportstorage"
    containerName: "fhir-exports"

  security:
    enableSmartProxy: true
    authority: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}"
    audience: "https://{workspace}.fhir.azurehealthcareapis.com"
```

---

## Clinical AI/ML Workloads

### Azure Machine Learning Configuration

```powershell
# Deploy private Azure ML workspace for PHI processing
New-AzMLWorkspace `
    -Name "clinical-ml-workspace" `
    -ResourceGroupName "healthcare-ai-rg" `
    -Location "westeurope" `
    -KeyVault "/subscriptions/{sub}/resourceGroups/keys-rg/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/phi-keyvault" `
    -StorageAccount "/subscriptions/{sub}/resourceGroups/healthcare-rg/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/phimlstorage" `
    -PublicNetworkAccess "Disabled"
```

### PHI Processing Guidelines

{: .warning }
>
> **⚠️ PHI in AI/ML Workloads**
> All machine learning models trained on PHI must be:
>
> - Trained within approved regions
> - Logged for audit purposes
> - Tested for bias and fairness
> - Subject to model governance review
