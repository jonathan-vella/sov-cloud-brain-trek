# Module 1: Zero Trust Security for Sovereign Clouds

{: .no_toc }

## Overview

{: .no_toc .text-delta }

Master the Zero Trust security model and its application to sovereign cloud environments. This module covers foundational principles, sovereign-specific requirements, implementation patterns, and compliance integration for advanced security architects.

**Duration:** 3-4 hours  
**Learning Tracks:** Sales & Technical  
**Prerequisites:** Level 200 completion

## Key Concepts

### What is Zero Trust?

**Zero Trust Security Model:** A security approach that assumes no implicit trust and requires continuous verification of all users, devices, and applications before granting access to resources.

**Traditional Perimeter Security (Legacy):**

```text
Internet ← Firewall ← Internal Network (Trusted)
          ↓
    Once inside perimeter, access assumed
```

**Zero Trust Model (Modern):**

```text
Every Access Request → Identity Verification
                    ↓
                Device Check
                    ↓
                Risk Assessment
                    ↓
                Conditional Access Policies
                    ↓
                    Grant (Limited, Monitored)
```

### Why Zero Trust for Sovereign Clouds?

**1. Enhanced Control:**

- Customer maintains explicit control over all access decisions
- No implicit trust based on network location
- Meets sovereign cloud requirement: "Customer control over access"

**2. Regulatory Alignment:**

- FedRAMP mandates continuous monitoring and verification
- GDPR requires granular access controls for data protection
- HIPAA requires audit trails for all access
- ITAR requires explicit user/device validation

**3. Data Protection:**

- Access tied to business need and risk level
- Sensitive data accessible only with highest verification
- Compliance data stays within sovereign boundary

**4. Operational Independence:**

- Works in disconnected environments (local verification)
- Doesn't depend on cloud provider infrastructure
- Local enforcement of access policies

## The Six Zero Trust Pillars


### Pillar 1: Identity

Verify every user's identity before access. Not based on network location or past authentication.

**Key Controls:**

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Passwordless authentication options
- Conditional Access based on user risk
- Just-in-time (JIT) access elevation

### Pillar 2: Device

Ensure device health and compliance before allowing access to resources.

**Key Controls:**

- Device compliance assessment
- Health attestation
- Device management enrollment
- Conditional Access based on device status

### Pillar 3: Network

Assume external network is untrusted. Implement microsegmentation and monitoring.

**Key Controls:**

- Network microsegmentation
- VPN or SD-WAN enforcement
- Encrypted communications
- Network monitoring and anomaly detection

### Pillar 4: Application

Protect applications with authentication and authorization at application layer.

**Key Controls:**

- Application-level authentication
- API security and validation
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Application monitoring and logging

### Pillar 5: Data

Classify, encrypt, and protect sensitive data. Ensure access is logged and monitored.

**Key Controls:**

- Data classification
- Encryption in transit and at rest
- Access logging and audit trails
- Tokenization or redaction

### Pillar 6: Infrastructure

Secure cloud infrastructure, container orchestration, and compute resources.

**Key Controls:**

- Infrastructure access controls
- Container security
- Compute resource hardening
- Infrastructure monitoring

## Sovereign Cloud-Specific Requirements


### Additional Sovereign Requirements

**Standard Cloud Zero Trust:**

- Baseline security controls
- Cloud provider managed infrastructure
- Regional availability
- Standard compliance frameworks

**Sovereign Cloud Zero Trust:**

- **Data Residency:** All access must occur within sovereign boundary
- **Customer Control:** Explicit customer control over all access policies
- **Government Compliance:** FedRAMP, GDPR, ITAR, or other frameworks
- **Air-Gap Capable:** Can operate in disconnected mode
- **Audit & Transparency:** Complete audit trail accessible to customer
- **Local Enforcement:** Access controls enforced locally, not cloud-dependent

### Compliance Integration

**FedRAMP Requirements:**

- Continuous monitoring of access (AC-2, AC-3)
- Enforcement of user-based controls (AC-4)
- Automated audit logging (AU-2, AU-12)

**GDPR Requirements:**

- Data subject rights (access, deletion, portability)
- Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)
- Encryption and pseudonymization
- Access logging for compliance

**HIPAA Requirements:**

- Access controls based on role and need
- Audit controls for all access
- Encryption of healthcare data
- De-identification procedures

**ITAR Requirements:**

- U.S. person verification
- Controlled access to technical data
- Storage within approved regions
- Export control compliance
