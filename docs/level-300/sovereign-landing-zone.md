## Overview

A Sovereign Landing Zone provides a standardized, secure foundation for deploying workloads that must comply with data residency, regulatory, and operational sovereignty requirements. This architecture implements Azure's Cloud Adoption Framework principles with sovereignty-specific enhancements.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will be able to:

- ✅ Design a complete sovereign landing zone architecture
- ✅ Implement management group hierarchy for governance
- ✅ Configure network topology for sovereignty requirements
- ✅ Apply policy-as-code for compliance enforcement

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Completed Level 200 modules
- [ ] Understanding of Azure management groups and subscriptions
- [ ] Familiarity with Azure Policy and governance concepts

### Management Group Hierarchy

The sovereign landing zone uses a hierarchical management group structure:

| Level | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Root | Tenant-wide governance | Contoso Root |
| Platform | Central IT services | Platform MG |
| Landing Zones | Workload subscriptions | EU Landing Zones |
| Sandbox | Development/testing | Dev/Test MG |

### Core Components

#### 1. Identity & Access

- **Microsoft Entra ID** — Centralized identity with conditional access
- **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)** — Just-in-time access
- **Customer Lockbox** — Operator access approval

#### 2. Network Topology

- **Hub-Spoke Architecture** — Centralized connectivity
- **Azure Firewall** — Egress filtering and threat protection
- **ExpressRoute** — Private connectivity to on-premises
- **Private Endpoints** — PaaS service isolation

#### 3. Security & Compliance

- **Azure Policy** — Guardrails and compliance automation
- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** — Security posture management
- **Key Vault with HSM** — Centralized secrets and key management
- **Log Analytics** — Centralized logging and monitoring

## Multi-Region Deployment

For organizations requiring geographic redundancy within sovereignty boundaries:

</div>
</details>

### Region Selection Criteria

When selecting Azure regions for sovereign deployments:

1. **Data Residency** — Regions within sovereignty boundary
2. **Compliance Certifications** — Required regulatory approvals
3. **Service Availability** — Needed Azure services present
4. **Latency Requirements** — Performance for end users

## Hybrid Identity Architecture

Organizations with on-premises Active Directory require hybrid identity integration:

### Identity Synchronization Options

| Option | Use Case | Sovereignty Impact |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| Password Hash Sync | Cloud-first | Hashes stored in cloud |
| Pass-through Auth | On-premises control | No password data in cloud |
| Federation (AD FS) | Full on-premises | Complete identity sovereignty |

---

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Define management group hierarchy
- [ ] Create platform subscriptions (connectivity, identity, management)
- [ ] Deploy hub virtual network with Azure Firewall
- [ ] Configure ExpressRoute or VPN connectivity
- [ ] Implement Azure Policy initiatives
- [ ] Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud
- [ ] Deploy Log Analytics workspace
- [ ] Configure Microsoft Entra ID with PIM
