## Answer Key and Explanations

### Answer 1: B - On-demand self-service, Broad network access, Resource pooling, Rapid elasticity, Measured service

These are the five essential characteristics defined by NIST that distinguish cloud computing from traditional IT services.

### Answer 2: C - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

IaaS provides the most control as customers manage everything from the operating system up, while the provider manages only the underlying infrastructure.

### Answer 3: C - Confidentiality

The CIA triad consists of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability - the three fundamental principles of information security.

### Answer 4: C - Inherence factors (something you are)

Biometric factors like fingerprints and facial recognition are inherence factors because they're based on physical characteristics.

### Answer 5: D - Balance of control and cloud benefits

Hybrid cloud allows organizations to keep sensitive data on-premises while leveraging cloud benefits for other workloads.

### Answer 6: B - Azure Active Directory

Azure AD is Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management service.

### Answer 7: B - Using multiple layers of security controls

Defense in depth uses multiple security layers so that if one fails, others continue to provide protection.

### Answer 8: C - HIPAA

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act specifically protects healthcare data in the United States.

### Answer 9: B - CapEx requires large upfront investments, OpEx uses pay-as-you-consume

This represents the fundamental shift from capital expenditure to operational expenditure models in cloud computing.

### Answer 10: C - Azure Blob Storage

Blob storage is specifically designed for unstructured data like images, videos, documents, and backups.

### Answer 11: B - Providing users only the minimum permissions necessary for their role

Least privilege reduces security risk by limiting access to only what's absolutely necessary.

### Answer 12: C - Avoiding vendor lock-in

Multi-cloud primarily provides independence from any single vendor and negotiating leverage.

### Answer 13: A - Recovery Time Objective

RTO defines how quickly systems must be restored after a disaster.

### Answer 14: B - Data residency and location

Data sovereignty requires understanding and controlling where data is stored and processed.

### Answer 15: B - Clear division of security responsibilities between provider and customer

The model clearly defines what the provider secures vs. what the customer must secure.

### Answer 16: D - Public

Public data has no restrictions and causes no harm if disclosed widely.

### Answer 17: B - Data moving between systems

Encryption in transit protects data during transmission between different systems or locations.

### Answer 18: B - High availability and fault tolerance

Availability zones provide redundancy across physically separate data centers within a region.

### Answer 19: C - Isolate resources and limit attack spread

Segmentation limits lateral movement of attackers and contains potential breaches.

### Answer 20: C - Azure Portal

The Azure Portal provides the primary web-based graphical management interface for Azure resources.
