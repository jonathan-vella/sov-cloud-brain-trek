## What are National Partner Clouds?

**National Partner Clouds** are Azure cloud environments **operated by trusted in-country partners** rather than directly by Microsoft. These clouds provide the same Azure services and capabilities while meeting specific national sovereignty, security, and compliance requirements that mandate local operation and control.

### Core Concept

National Partner Clouds address scenarios where:

- **National regulations require local cloud operators** (e.g., government-only clouds)
- **Data must be under local legal jurisdiction** with no foreign government access
- **Operations and support must be provided by local entities**
- **Compliance certifications must be issued by national authorities**
- **Critical national infrastructure** requires sovereign cloud capabilities

**Key Principle:** "Azure services with national sovereignty through trusted local partners"

---

## Why National Partner Clouds Exist

### Regulatory and Legal Requirements

Many countries and sectors have regulations that require:

1. **Local Data Governance:** Data subject only to national laws
2. **Local Operations:** Cloud infrastructure operated by domestic entities
3. **Legal Jurisdiction:** Services under national court jurisdiction, not foreign
4. **Government Access Controls:** Protection from foreign government data access laws
5. **National Security:** Critical infrastructure under national control

**Example Regulations:**

- **United States:** FedRAMP (federal government), ITAR (defense), CJIS (criminal justice)
- **China:** Cybersecurity Law requiring local data storage and local operators
- **European Union:** GDPR and various national data protection laws
- **Russia:** Federal Law 242 requiring local data processing
