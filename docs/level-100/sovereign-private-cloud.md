## What is Sovereign Private Cloud?

**Sovereign Private Cloud** delivers Azure services on dedicated, customer-owned infrastructure, providing the **highest level of sovereignty and control** while maintaining Azure-consistent operations and management. It represents the evolution from traditional on-premises infrastructure to modern hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) with cloud-like capabilities.

### Core Concept

Sovereign Private Cloud brings Azure **to your data**, not your data to Azure. It provides:

- **Physical Isolation:** Dedicated hardware in customer-controlled facilities
- **Operational Independence:** Ability to operate with or without cloud connectivity
- **Local Control:** Customer control over hardware, updates, and operations
- **Azure Consistency:** Same APIs, tools, and management as Azure cloud
- **Flexible Connectivity:** Connected (hybrid) or Disconnected (air-gapped) modes

**Powered By: Azure Local** (formerly Azure Stack HCI)

**Key Principle:** "Azure services anywhere, including completely disconnected"

## Azure Local: Foundation of Sovereign Private Cloud

### What is Azure Local?

**Azure Local** is Microsoft's hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) solution that brings Azure services to on-premises or edge locations. It combines:

- **Compute:** Hyper-V virtualization for VMs and containers
- **Storage:** Storage Spaces Direct for software-defined storage
- **Networking:** Software-Defined Networking (SDN) for virtual networks
- **Management:** Azure Arc for cloud-based management (Connected mode) or Windows Admin Center (Disconnected mode)

**Official Definition from Microsoft:**
> "Azure Local is a hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) cluster solution that hosts virtualized Windows and Linux workloads and their storage in a hybrid on-premises environment. Azure Local brings Azure services, cloud-based management, and security to customer datacenters and edge locations." - [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-local/overview)

- 4-node cluster: $100,000-$140,000
- Networking: $20,000-$50,000 (switches, cables)
- Rack, power, cooling: $10,000-$30,000
- **Total CapEx:** $130,000-$220,000

**Operational Expenditure (OpEx) - Annual:**

- Azure Local subscription: ~$15,000-$25,000/year (for 4-node cluster)
- Hardware support/maintenance: ~$20,000-$30,000/year (20% of hardware cost)
- Power and cooling: ~$5,000-$10,000/year

**Concern:** "This sounds complicated. Is it harder to manage than traditional infrastructure?"

**Solution:**

- Azure Local uses familiar tools (Hyper-V, PowerShell, Windows Admin Center)
- Pre-built validated hardware reduces deployment complexity
- Microsoft FastTrack available for deployment assistance
- Training available via Microsoft Learn (free)
- **Reality:** Easier than managing separate compute, storage, networking

### Challenge 2: Update Management in Disconnected Mode

**Concern:** "How do we keep systems updated without internet access?"

**Solution:**

- Microsoft releases quarterly updates on encrypted removable media
- Updates delivered via classified channels (for defense customers)
- Test updates in non-production cluster first
- Windows Admin Center automates update orchestration across cluster
- **Process:** Similar to existing classified update processes

### Challenge 3: Skill Requirements

**Concern:** "Do we need new skills, or can our current team manage this?"

**Solution:**

- Builds on existing Windows Server and Hyper-V skills
- No need to learn new hypervisor (if coming from Hyper-V)
- Windows Admin Center provides GUI for common tasks
- Training paths available on Microsoft Learn
- **Timeline:** 2-4 weeks to train existing Windows admins

### Challenge 4: Support for Disconnected Mode

**Concern:** "How do we get support if we can't connect to internet or call Microsoft?"

**Solution:**

- Phone support with classified support line
- Email support via secure channels (SIPRNET for DoD)
- Joint support from Microsoft and OEM hardware vendor
- Remote support via SATCOM or disconnected VPN (for maritime)
- **Escalation:** Microsoft dedicated support team for disconnected scenarios
