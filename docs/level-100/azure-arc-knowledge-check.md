## Questions

### Question 1: Azure Arc Fundamentals

**What is the primary purpose of Azure Arc?**

A) To migrate workloads from on-premises to Azure cloud  
B) To extend Azure management and services to any infrastructure  
C) To replace existing infrastructure management tools  
D) To provide backup services for on-premises servers

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
Azure Arc's primary purpose is to extend Azure management, governance, and services to any infrastructure - on-premises, multi-cloud, or edge. It does not migrate workloads (that's Azure Migrate), doesn't replace tools (it complements them), and backup is just one of many capabilities.

**Reference:** [Azure Arc Introduction](azure-arc-intro#what-is-azure-arc)
</details>

### Question 2: Arc Services

**Which THREE services are part of Azure Arc? (Select all that apply)**

A) Arc-enabled Servers  
B) Arc-enabled Kubernetes  
C) Arc-enabled Data Services  
D) Arc-enabled Virtual Networks

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct Answer: A, B, C**

**Explanation:**
The three pillars of Azure Arc are Arc-enabled Servers (Windows/Linux machines), Arc-enabled Kubernetes (any CNCF-certified K8s), and Arc-enabled Data Services (SQL MI and PostgreSQL). Arc-enabled Virtual Networks is not an Arc service.

**Reference:** [Three Pillars of Azure Arc](azure-arc-intro#three-pillars-of-azure-arc)
</details>

---

### Question 3: Data Residency

**In Azure Arc, what type of data is sent to Azure from Arc-enabled Servers?**

A) All application data and databases  
B) Only metadata, metrics, logs, and configuration - not workload data  
C) Only credentials and passwords  
D) All data is kept 100% local with no Azure sync

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
Arc synchronizes metadata (inventory, configuration), metrics, and logs to Azure for management purposes, but workload data (application data, databases, files) stays on-premises. This enables cloud-based management while maintaining data sovereignty.

**Reference:** [Arc and Sovereignty](azure-arc-intro#arc-and-sovereignty)
</details>

---

### Question 4: Arc-Enabled Servers

**What is required to onboard a Windows or Linux server to Azure Arc?**

A) The server must be migrated to Azure first  
B) Install the Connected Machine agent and provide Azure authentication  
C) The server must be domain-joined  
D) Purchase special Arc licenses

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
Onboarding requires installing the Connected Machine agent on the server and authenticating to Azure (via service principal or interactive login). Servers can be anywhere (not just Azure), domain-join is optional, and Arc itself has no additional license cost.

**Reference:** [Arc Servers Onboarding](azure-arc-servers#onboarding-process-and-architecture)
</details>

---

### Question 5: GitOps

**What is the primary benefit of using GitOps with Arc-enabled Kubernetes?**

A) Faster Kubernetes cluster creation  
B) Git repository becomes the source of truth for cluster configuration with automatic synchronization  
C) Eliminates the need for kubectl  
D) Reduces Kubernetes licensing costs

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
GitOps uses Git as the source of truth for cluster configuration. Changes committed to Git automatically sync to clusters via Flux, providing version control, audit trail, and consistent deployments. It doesn't create clusters, doesn't eliminate kubectl (complements it), and Kubernetes is open source (no licensing).

**Reference:** [GitOps Configuration Management](azure-arc-kubernetes#gitops-based-configuration-management)
</details>

---

### Question 6: Azure Policy

**Which of the following can Azure Policy do for Arc-enabled Servers?**

A) Automatically migrate servers to Azure  
B) Audit compliance and optionally remediate configuration drift  
C) Replace the server operating system  
D) Increase server hardware resources

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
Azure Policy can audit server configurations for compliance and optionally remediate drift (deploy missing extensions, configure settings, etc.). It doesn't migrate servers, change OS, or modify hardware - those require different tools/processes.

**Reference:** [Applying Azure Policy](azure-arc-servers#applying-azure-policy)
</details>

---

### Question 7: Multi-Cloud Support

**Azure Arc supports managing resources in which of the following?**

A) Only Microsoft Azure  
B) Only on-premises  
C) Azure, AWS, GCP, and any infrastructure  
D) Only Microsoft technologies

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
Azure Arc supports any infrastructure - Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, on-premises, edge, and any other cloud. It's designed for multi-cloud and hybrid scenarios and supports non-Microsoft technologies (Linux, any K8s distribution, PostgreSQL, etc.).

**Reference:** [Multi-Cloud Governance](azure-arc-intro#multi-cloud-governance-capabilities)
</details>

---

### Question 8: Use Case Selection

**A retail company has 200 stores with local Kubernetes clusters running POS applications. They want consistent deployment and security policies. Which Arc service is best?**

A) Arc-enabled Servers  
B) Arc-enabled Kubernetes  
C) Arc-enabled Data Services  
D) Azure Migrate

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
Arc-enabled Kubernetes is designed for managing multiple Kubernetes clusters with consistent GitOps deployment and Azure Policy enforcement. Arc Servers is for individual machines, Data Services is for databases, and Azure Migrate is for migrations (not management).

**Reference:** [Arc Kubernetes Scenarios](azure-arc-kubernetes#use-case-scenarios)
</details>

---

### Question 9: Arc Data Services Licensing

**Which licensing models are available for Azure SQL Managed Instance on Arc?**

A) Only pay-as-you-go  
B) Only bring-your-own-license (BYOL)  
C) Both pay-as-you-go and BYOL with Azure Hybrid Benefit  
D) Free (no licensing cost)

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
Arc SQL MI supports both pay-as-you-go (Azure consumption billing) and BYOL where you can bring existing SQL Server licenses and leverage Azure Hybrid Benefit for up to 55% savings. It's not free - either model incurs costs.

**Reference:** [Data Services Billing](azure-arc-data-services#billing-model)
</details>

---

### Question 10: High Availability

**How does Azure SQL Managed Instance on Arc provide high availability?**

A) By replicating to Azure SQL Database  
B) Using Always-On Availability Groups with automatic failover  
C) By creating manual backups every hour  
D) High availability is not supported on Arc

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
Arc SQL MI uses Always-On Availability Groups (AG) with synchronous replication and automatic failover, providing 99.95% SLA. It doesn't replicate to Azure SQL Database, hourly backups don't provide HA, and HA is a core feature.

**Reference:** [Elastic Scale and HA](azure-arc-data-services#elastic-scale-and-high-availability)
</details>

---

### Question 11: Deployment Modes

**What is the main difference between Directly Connected and Indirectly Connected modes for Arc Data Services?**

A) Performance (Directly Connected is faster)  
B) Direct mode has continuous Azure connectivity, Indirect mode is air-gapped with manual exports  
C) Cost (Indirect mode is more expensive)  
D) Features (Indirect mode has more features)

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
Directly Connected mode maintains regular connectivity to Azure with automatic billing uploads and Azure portal management. Indirectly Connected mode supports air-gapped scenarios with manual export/import of usage data and local management only. Performance is similar, costs are based on usage, and Direct mode has more features (not Indirect).

**Reference:** [Deployment Modes](azure-arc-data-services#deployment-modes)
</details>

---

### Question 12: Cost and Licensing

**What is included in the cost of using Azure Arc itself?**

A) High per-server licensing fees  
B) Azure Arc has no additional charge - you pay only for Azure services consumed  
C) Requires Enterprise Agreement  
D) Monthly subscription per cluster

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
Azure Arc itself is free - there's no charge to connect servers, Kubernetes clusters, or deploy the data controller. You only pay for Azure services you consume (Azure Monitor, Defender, Update Management, etc.). No EA required, no per-server fees, no subscriptions for Arc itself.

**Reference:** [Arc Servers Cost Model](azure-arc-servers#cost-model-and-licensing)
</details>
