## Overview

Microsoft recognizes that organizations have diverse sovereignty requirements based on their industry, regulatory obligations, and operational needs. To address this spectrum of requirements, Microsoft offers **three distinct sovereign cloud models** that provide varying levels of control, isolation, and compliance capabilities.

These models enable organizations to:

- **Balance sovereignty needs with cloud benefits:** Maintain control while leveraging cloud innovation
- **Meet regulatory requirements:** Comply with local laws and industry-specific regulations
- **Optimize for specific use cases:** Choose the right model based on workload characteristics
- **Scale as needs evolve:** Transition between models as requirements change

### Why Multiple Models Matter

Different organizations have different sovereignty needs:

- A European bank may need data residency guarantees but can operate in a shared infrastructure
- A defense contractor requires physical isolation and no external connectivity
- A government agency needs infrastructure operated by local entities with regional compliance certifications

**No single solution fits all scenarios.** Microsoft's three-model approach provides flexibility while maintaining high security and compliance standards.

- Customer Lockbox for access control
- Azure Policy for compliance automation
- Confidential computing capabilities

**Best For:**

- Regulated industries (finance, healthcare, energy)
- Organizations requiring GDPR, HIPAA, or similar compliance
- Workloads needing cloud scalability with data residency
- Customers wanting balance between control and cloud benefits

### 2. Sovereign Private Cloud

**Definition:** Dedicated infrastructure running Azure services on-premises via Azure Local (formerly Azure Stack HCI), providing physical isolation and local control.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Dedicated, single-tenant infrastructure
- Physical hardware in customer-controlled facilities
- Connected mode (hybrid with Azure) or Disconnected mode (air-gapped)
- Local control plane option for maximum sovereignty
- Azure-consistent services and management
- Validated hardware from Microsoft partners

### 3. National Partner Clouds

**Definition:** Azure infrastructure operated by trusted national partners, providing sovereign cloud services with local data governance, operations, and support.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Infrastructure operated by in-country partners
- Local data governance and legal jurisdiction
- Regional compliance certifications
- Isolated from global Azure (logical separation)
- Local support and operations teams
- Tailored to national requirements

**Examples:**

- **Azure Government (United States)** - FedRAMP High, DoD IL5, ITAR

   - ✅ Microsoft: Multiple national clouds (US, China)
   - ⚠️ AWS: GovCloud US only

**When to Mention:**

- Customer requires air-gapped operations
- Customer needs unified management across hybrid environments
- Customer requires DoD IL6 or specific national cloud
- Customer wants policy-driven sovereignty controls

### vs. Google Cloud

**Microsoft Advantages:**

1. **Sovereign Private Cloud:**
   - ✅ Microsoft: Full Azure Local with broad service portfolio
   - ⚠️ Google: Anthos limited to Kubernetes workloads

2. **National Partner Clouds:**
   - ✅ Microsoft: Azure Government (US), Azure China
   - ❌ Google: No national partner clouds

3. **Government Compliance:**
   - ✅ Microsoft: FedRAMP High, DoD IL5/IL6, ITAR
   - ⚠️ Google: Limited FedRAMP High regions, no DoD IL6

4. **Enterprise Integration:**
   - ✅ Microsoft: Seamless integration with Microsoft 365, Dynamics, Power Platform
   - ⚠️ Google: Limited enterprise suite integration

5. **Compliance Certifications:**
   - ✅ Microsoft: 100+ certifications, most comprehensive
   - ⚠️ Google: ~60 certifications, fewer than Microsoft or AWS

**When to Mention:**

- Customer has Microsoft enterprise agreement
- Customer requires government-specific compliance
- Customer needs more than Kubernetes on-premises
- Customer requires national partner cloud operations

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

### Best Practices

#### For All Models

✅ **Start with Data Classification**

- Map all data types and sensitivity levels
- Document data flows and processing locations
- Align cloud model choice with data requirements
- Implement data lifecycle management

✅ **Implement Policy-Driven Compliance**

- Use Azure Policy to enforce sovereignty requirements
- Automate compliance checks and reporting
- Implement deny policies for non-compliant configurations
- Regular policy audits and updates

✅ **Design for Resilience**

- Implement high availability within sovereignty boundaries
- Plan disaster recovery within compliant regions
- Test failover and recovery procedures
- Document recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO)

✅ **Plan for Growth**

- Choose model that scales with your needs
- Consider future regulatory changes
- Design for model transition if requirements change
- Maintain flexibility in architecture

---

#### Sovereign Public Cloud Specific

✅ **Use Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty**

- Deploy sovereignty guardrails from day one
- Configure data residency policies
- Enable Customer Lockbox for support scenarios
- Implement confidential computing for sensitive workloads

✅ **Leverage Azure Policy**

- Enforce regional restrictions on resource creation
- Audit compliance continuously
- Implement automatic remediation where possible
- Document policy exceptions with justification

---

#### Sovereign Private Cloud Specific

✅ **Right-Size Your Hardware**

- Plan for 3-5 year capacity needs
- Include growth buffer (20-30%)
- Consider seasonal or burst capacity requirements
- Validate hardware specifications with Azure Local requirements

✅ **Plan Update Strategy**

- Document update and patch process
- For Disconnected: Plan offline update delivery
- Test updates in non-production first
- Maintain update history and documentation

✅ **Implement Monitoring**

- Deploy monitoring before production workloads
- Set up alerting for capacity and performance
- Monitor hardware health and predictive failures
- Document operational procedures

---

### Common Pitfalls

#### ❌ Choosing the Wrong Model

**Pitfall:** Selecting model based on perception rather than requirements

**Example:** Choosing Sovereign Private Cloud because "it sounds more secure" when Sovereign Public Cloud meets requirements at lower cost

**How to Avoid:**

- Complete thorough requirements assessment
- Use decision framework systematically
- Consider total cost of ownership
- Prototype/POC before full commitment

---

#### ❌ Underestimating Operational Complexity

**Pitfall:** Assuming on-premises Azure Local is "as easy as cloud"

**Example:** Deploying Azure Local without trained staff or operational procedures

**How to Avoid:**

- Invest in training for operations team
- Start with Connected mode before Disconnected
- Document operational runbooks
- Plan for ongoing maintenance and support

---

#### ❌ Ignoring Network Requirements

**Pitfall:** Not planning for bandwidth, latency, and connectivity needs

**Example:** Deploying Azure Local in Connected mode without sufficient internet bandwidth

**How to Avoid:**

- Assess network requirements for chosen model
- Plan for ExpressRoute if needed
- Consider bandwidth for updates, backups, and monitoring
- Test connectivity and latency before go-live

---

#### ❌ Over-Complicating with Multiple Models

**Pitfall:** Using all three models when one would suffice

**Example:** Deploying Azure Local "just in case" when all requirements can be met in Sovereign Public Cloud

**How to Avoid:**

- Start with simplest model that meets requirements
- Add complexity only when justified
- Consider management overhead of multiple models
- Plan integration and governance strategy

---

#### ❌ Forgetting About Data Egress

**Pitfall:** Not considering data transfer costs and restrictions

**Example:** Regular large data transfers from Sovereign Private Cloud to Azure for analytics

**How to Avoid:**

- Understand data residency vs. data processing requirements
- Plan for data minimization and edge analytics
- Consider costs of data egress in model selection
- Implement data lifecycle policies
