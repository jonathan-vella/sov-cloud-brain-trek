### Question 11: Azure Policy for Sovereignty

A company wants to automatically prevent any resources from being created outside the EU. What should they implement?

A) Azure Firewall rules  
B) Network Security Groups (NSGs)  
C) Azure Policy with deny effect for non-EU regions  
D) Customer Lockbox

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
Azure Policy with a **deny effect** can automatically prevent resource creation in non-EU regions by evaluating resource properties at creation time. This is the enforcement mechanism used in Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty's EU Data Boundary.

- Azure Firewall controls network traffic (not resource creation)
- NSGs control network access (not geographic restrictions)
- Customer Lockbox controls support access (not resource placement)

**Reference:** [Azure Policy for Sovereignty](sovereign-public-cloud#1-eu-data-boundary)
</details>

**Total Questions:** 15  
**Passing Score:** 12/15 (80%)
**Correct:** To enforce sovereignty requirements through policy-driven controls in Azure public cloud

**Explanation:** Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty is NOT a separate cloud platform. It's a set of capabilities, policies, and configurations that run on top of Azure public cloud to enforce sovereignty requirements automatically through Azure Policy and other controls. This allows customers to get all Azure benefits while meeting sovereignty needs.

**Review:** [Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty](sovereign-public-cloud#microsoft-cloud-for-sovereignty)

---

### Answer 4: C

**Correct:** Customer Lockbox

**Explanation:** Customer Lockbox requires customer approval before Microsoft support engineers can access customer data. This provides:

- Customer control over support access
- Audit trail of all access requests
- Time-limited access with automatic expiration
- No access granted without explicit customer approval

Azure Policy enforces compliance, Azure Firewall controls network traffic, and Azure Key Vault stores encryption keys - none provide support access approval.

**Review:** [Customer Lockbox](sovereign-public-cloud#2-customer-lockbox)

---

### Answer 5: B

**Correct:** Connected mode requires internet connectivity and uses cloud control plane; Disconnected mode operates independently

**Explanation:**

- **Connected Mode:** Requires ongoing internet connectivity to Azure, uses Azure portal for management, provides hybrid services
- **Disconnected Mode:** No internet required, uses local control plane (Windows Admin Center), operates independently

The key difference is the dependency on Azure connectivity and where the control plane resides (cloud vs. local).

**Review:** [Operating Modes Comparison](sovereign-private-cloud#operating-modes-connected-vs-disconnected)

---

### Answer 6: D

**Correct:** Azure Local Disconnected Mode

**Explanation:** For completely air-gapped environments (no internet connectivity), Azure Local Disconnected Mode is the only option that:

- ✅ Operates without any internet connectivity
- ✅ Uses local control plane (no cloud dependencies)
- ✅ Provides Azure-consistent services on-premises
- ✅ Supports completely isolated operations

Azure Government still requires internet connectivity. Connected Mode by definition needs connectivity. Sovereign Public Cloud requires cloud connection.

**Review:** [Azure Local Disconnected Mode](sovereign-private-cloud#disconnected-mode-air-gapped)

---

**Explanation:** Azure Government is:

- ✅ Operated by Microsoft (not a third-party partner)
- ✅ Physically separate data centers from commercial Azure
- ✅ Logically isolated network infrastructure
- ✅ Has MORE compliance certifications than commercial (FedRAMP High, DoD IL6)
- ✅ Available only to US government entities and partners (not worldwide)

**Review:** [Azure Government Overview](national-partner-clouds#1-azure-government-united-states)

---

### Answer 8: B

**Correct:** To meet Chinese regulatory requirements for local cloud operators

**Explanation:** China's Cybersecurity Law requires that cloud services in China be operated by Chinese companies with local data storage. 21Vianet is a licensed Chinese telecommunications provider that operates Azure China to comply with these regulations. Microsoft provides the technology and support to 21Vianet, but 21Vianet handles operations, billing, and customer support.

**Review:** [Azure China (21Vianet)](national-partner-clouds#2-azure-china-21vianet-operated)

---

### Answer 9: C

**Correct:** Data in use (during processing)

**Explanation:** Azure Confidential Computing protects data **while it's being processed** using hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This completes the encryption story:

- **Data at Rest:** Azure Storage Encryption, Azure Disk Encryption
- **Data in Transit:** TLS/SSL encryption
- **Data in Use:** Confidential Computing (Intel SGX, AMD SEV-SNP)

This protects against cloud provider access, privileged admins, and hardware attacks.

**Review:** [Confidential Computing](sovereign-public-cloud#4-confidential-computing)

---

**Explanation:** Infrastructure types by model:

- **Sovereign Public Cloud:** Shared infrastructure with logical isolation
- **Sovereign Private Cloud (Azure Local):** Dedicated, single-tenant physical infrastructure
- **National Partner Clouds:** Shared infrastructure (partner-operated)

Only Sovereign Private Cloud provides dedicated physical hardware exclusively for one customer.

**Review:** [Model Comparison Matrix](sovereign-cloud-models#model-comparison-matrix)

---

### Answer 11: C

**Correct:** Azure Policy with deny effect for non-EU regions

**Explanation:** Azure Policy with a "deny" effect is the correct approach to prevent resource creation outside allowed regions. The policy evaluates resource creation requests and denies any that don't match the specified EU regions.

Example policy:

```json
{
  "if": {
    "not": {
      "field": "location",
      "in": ["westeurope", "northeurope", "francecentral"]
    }
  },
  "then": {
    "effect": "deny"
  }
}
```

Azure Firewall controls network traffic, NSGs control subnet traffic, and Customer Lockbox controls support access - none prevent resource creation in specific regions.

**Review:** [Azure Policy for Compliance](sovereign-public-cloud#3-azure-policy-for-compliance-automation)

---

### Answer 12: B

**Correct:** Azure Government

**Explanation:** Azure Government is specifically designed for US government workloads and is the only Microsoft cloud with:

- FedRAMP High authorization
- DoD Impact Level 5 and 6 authorization
- Physical and logical separation from commercial cloud
- US persons-only support

Azure commercial cloud (global) has FedRAMP Moderate only. Azure China is for Chinese operations. Policy enforcement alone doesn't provide FedRAMP authorization.

**Review:** [Azure Government Compliance](national-partner-clouds#1-azure-government-united-states)

---

- Defense and intelligence scenarios
- Complete operational independence

Scenario analysis:

- Retail with elastic needs: Sovereign Public Cloud (elasticity needed)
- Startup mobile app: Sovereign Public Cloud or commercial cloud (need scalability)
- Aerospace with classified data: Sovereign Private Cloud Disconnected (air-gap required)
- SaaS provider: Sovereign Public Cloud (global reach and scalability)

**Review:** [Use Cases - Defense Contractor](sovereign-private-cloud#scenario-1-defense-contractor---classified-workloads)

---

### Answer 14: B

**Correct:** Azure Arc to manage hybrid resources from Azure control plane

**Explanation:** Azure Arc provides unified management for hybrid and multi-cloud environments by:

- Projecting on-premises and multi-cloud resources into Azure Resource Manager
- Enabling Azure management tools (portal, CLI, ARM templates) for all resources
- Applying Azure Policy across hybrid resources
- Providing unified monitoring via Azure Monitor

This provides a single control plane for managing resources across cloud and on-premises, which is essential for hybrid sovereignty scenarios.

**Review:** [Hybrid Architecture Scenarios](sovereign-private-cloud#scenario-3-healthcare---rural-hospital-network)

---

### Answer 15: C

**Correct:** Steady-state workloads with consistent resource utilization

**Explanation:** Azure Local (Sovereign Private Cloud) TCO considerations:

**When cost-effective:**

- ✅ Steady-state workloads (consistent utilization amortizes CapEx)
- ✅ Long-term deployment (3-5 years to recover hardware investment)
- ✅ Data gravity (large datasets, high I/O, expensive to move)
- ✅ Latency requirements (can't tolerate cloud latency)

**When NOT cost-effective:**

- ❌ Variable/unpredictable workloads (cloud elasticity more economical)
- ❌ Short-term projects (can't amortize CapEx over short period)
- ❌ Dev/test environments (cloud pay-as-you-go better)

**Review:** [Total Cost of Ownership](sovereign-private-cloud#total-cost-of-ownership-tco)
