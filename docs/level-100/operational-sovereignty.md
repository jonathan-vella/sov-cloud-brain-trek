## Introduction

Operational sovereignty refers to an organization's ability to maintain control and independence over the operation, management, and access of their IT infrastructure and data. While data residency focuses on _where_ data is stored, operational sovereignty addresses _who_ can access it, _how_ it's managed, and _under what conditions_.

For many organizations—particularly those in government, defense, and critical infrastructure—operational sovereignty is as important as, or more important than, data residency.

## What Is Operational Sovereignty?

### Definition

**Operational Sovereignty:** The ability to control and operate IT infrastructure independently, without dependency on external entities or foreign jurisdictions.

### Key Dimensions

**1. Control Plane Location:**

- Where management services operate
- Who has access to infrastructure controls
- Can the system operate without cloud connectivity

**2. Personnel Access:**

- Where operations staff are located
- Citizenship and clearance requirements
- Background check requirements

**3. Legal Jurisdiction:**

- Which laws govern data access
- Where legal recourse is available
- Exposure to foreign government requests

**4. Operational Independence:**

- Ability to operate during connectivity outages
- No dependency on external services
- Self-sufficient operations

---

## Why Operational Sovereignty Matters

### National Security

**Government and Defense:**

- Prevents foreign access to sensitive systems
- Protects classified information
- Maintains operational capabilities during conflicts

**Example:** A defense agency needs to ensure that only cleared US personnel can access classified systems, with no dependency on internet connectivity or external cloud services.

### Regulatory Compliance

**Industry Regulations:**

- Some regulations specify operational requirements
- Personnel location and citizenship requirements
- Audit and oversight requirements

**Example:** ITAR requires that only "US Persons" (citizens and permanent residents) can access export-controlled technical data.

### Business Continuity

**Operational Risk:**

- Reduced dependency on external entities
- Ability to operate during geopolitical events
- Protection from service provider changes

**Example:** A critical infrastructure provider needs to maintain operations even if disconnected from the internet due to cyberattack or natural disaster.

### Legal Protection

**Jurisdictional Control:**

- Avoid exposure to foreign laws
- Clearer legal recourse options
- Reduced complexity in compliance

**Example:** A European company wants to avoid potential US government data access requests under the CLOUD Act.
